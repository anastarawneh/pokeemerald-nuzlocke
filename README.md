# Pokémon Emerald Nuzlocke Helper

This is a ROM hack created to help you keep track of your Pokémon Emerald nuzlocke encounters, by only allowing one catch per area.

Available options:
- Dupes Clause (Allowed to change an encounter if a Pokémon of the same species was already caught)
- Species Clause (Allowed to change the encounter if a Pokémon of the same evolutionary line was already caught)
- Count gift Pokémon as encounters (Prevent another encounter on the same route as the starter/a gift Pokémon, and lock the gift Pokémon if an encounter was already made)
- Count ingame trades (Prevent another encounter on the same route as the trade, and lock the trade if an encounter was already made)
- Allow Shedinja (Normal encounter rules still apply, but Shedinja is banned by default because it inherits the `Met at` property from the Nincada it evolved from)
- A way to override the nuzlocke and be able to throw Pokéballs (Hold `R` while using the Pokéball)
